= Some fun with Monte-Carlo generic game engines

This project has two purposes: I'm using it teach myself Java and to learn about [general game playing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing), and in particular, the application of [Monte-Carlo tree search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). Here is a good [survey of Monte-Carlo techniques](http://www.cameronius.com/cv/mcts-survey-master.pdf) in relation to game playing.

I'm starting with testing the engines on [Gomoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), because it has really simple rules, but my ultimate goal is to play some imperfect information games with chance.
